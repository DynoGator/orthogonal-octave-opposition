## 1.0 Abstract
Current mass transport relies on bulk thermodynamic forcing. This paper proposes **Field-Assisted Phase Decoupling** utilizing Orthogonal Octave Opposition (OOO). By locking a fundamental frequency ($f$) and its harmonic ($2f$) in a mirrored quadrature relationship, we generate a localized impedance gradient. Applying a phase asymmetry ($90^\circ \pm \delta$) induces **Inertial Shear**, allowing for vectoring of target species (e.g., $H_2O$) while rejecting contaminants based on dielectric relaxation time.

## 2.0 Theoretical Framework
### 2.1 Topology
The system employs two orthogonal, counter-propagating wavefronts:
* **Axis A:** Fundamental ($f$) at $\theta = 0^\circ$
* **Axis B:** Harmonic ($2f$) at $\theta = 90^\circ$

This creates a time-averaged rotating vector field. Locomotion is achieved by breaking symmetry (Linear Induction Motor principle scaled to molecular dipoles).

### 2.2 Mechanism
* **Static Lock ($90^\circ$):** Stationary potential well. No drift.
* **Shear Offset ($91.2^\circ$):** Creates a traveling low-impedance region. Target molecules migrate "downhill."

## 3.0 Thermodynamics
This system is **not reactionless**. The emitter array functions as the reaction mass. No entropy decrease occurs locally without compensating entropy increase in the power electronics.

## 4.0 Applications
### 4.1 The Inertial Sieve (Desalination)
* **Target:** $H_2O$ (Fast relaxation).
* **Contaminant:** Solvated Ions (Slow relaxation).
* **Mechanism:** When shear frequency exceeds ion response time ($\tau_{ion} > \tau_{shear}$), ions slip while water grips.

### 4.2 Field-Stabilized Nucleation
Returning to Hard Lock ($90^\circ$) during cooling forces lattice geometry, preventing defect formation (virtual mold).

## 5.0 Experimental Validation: "The Silencer"
**Setup:** U-Tube with 3.5% saline. Emitters on Right Arm.
1. **Control:** Random Phase -> Zero Transport.
2. **Shear:** Phase Sweep ($0-5^\circ$).
**Prediction:** Mass flow peaks at resonant $\delta$ (Bell Curve) and collapses at slippage limit.

## 6.0 Constraints
* **Frequency Stability:** $< 0.01$ Hz required.
* **Phase Resolution:** $0.01^\circ$ required.
* **Failure Mode:** $\delta > 4^\circ$ leads to decoherence (stall).

## 7.0 Conclusion
OOO represents a shift from Force-Based to Impedance-Based engineering, utilizing harmonic signatures for efficient transport.
